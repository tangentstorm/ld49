#+title: (as yet untitled) oK defender clone

* DONE pan camera across virtual landscape
* DONE generate a landscape
probably about 5 screens worth  (* 320 5) -> 1600 pixels wide
* DONE generate heights of the land tiles
* DONE draw the minimap
- single pixels for aliens, humans, and hero
- generated from real map

* DONE spawn humans (on the ground)
* DONE spawn initial aliens (in the air)
* DONE aliens move towards nearest humans
* DONE [3/3] aliens abduct humans
** DONE turn on beam when alen above human
** DONE remove human from ground once beam is engaged
** DONE ships should start going back into the sky
* DONE implement rectangle vs rectangle collisions

* DONE garbage collect phasers
- when they hit something
- when they expire (each one should have a clock)

* DONE collision dection for phasers+aliens
- destroy the alien ship (just delet for now)
- if alHH, then spawn a falling human (probably 'fh', separate from 'hu')

* DONE shooting an alien that holds a human should drop human
* DONE collision detection for ship + falling human
* DONE cylindrical topology (with single vertical seam)
(so you can go all around the world in x direction)

* DONE move minimap camera box as ship moves
* DONE clamp ship in y direction
- can't go higher than bottom of minimap
- just don't allow going lower than y=146



* TODO [#A] fix bug that causes spurious crashes when aliens reach bottom
* TODO [#A] show aliens on the radar
* TODO [#A] spawn more aliens over time
* TODO [#A] spaceship inertia/drag
* TODO [#A] handle the case where 2 aliens move toward same person
(once one picks it up, the other must change course)
if any duplicates in the list of targets, replace with random targets
* ---------
* TODO [#B] track whether ship is carrying a human, and if so, drop off on ground
- need to track if you're down there so that you can "drop off" the person
* TODO [#B] collision detection for ship+alien (game over)
* TODO [#B] collision detection between ground + falling human
this should count as a death

* TODO [#B] draw some cities (a city?) where humans are "safe"
* TODO [#B] scoring: time to saving all living humans
maybe you win by bringing all surviving humans to the city before you die
and then your score is your time + #aliens killed - humans killed/abducted
** TODO keep score (maybe time survived, plus #saved?)
time survived = f
** TODO draw score (as some kind of clock)
** TODO count how many people die
** TODO end game when too many people die (or you crash into alien)
- this is a nihilistic game where you can never
- win but only prolong the inevitable

* TODO [#B] cool explosion animation when the alien blows up
* TODO [#B] have camera smoothly follow the ship
* TODO [#C] collision detection for phasers + falling human (toast them)
* TODO [#C] set sprite direction of phasers
* TODO [#C] collision detection for phasers + beams (with humans)
* TODO [#C] only draw sprites that are on screen
can probably extract most of this logic from copyLeftSide

* TODO [#C] screenflow
** TODO game over
** TODO title screen
** TODO pause screen
